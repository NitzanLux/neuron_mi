This project aims to evaluate the Algorithmic Complexity of a Neuron Biophysical model
The Brain is high heterogeneous some neurons have few connections while others may have a large number of connections. for example, the Pyramidal neuron in layer 5 in the human cortex has between 10,000-40,000 synapses, where its output is one dimensional(in time).

Using the NEURON enviroment we can explore different neurons algorithmic complexity
